# Random-Message-Generator

## Description
This project has been created to help me learn and practice JavaScript and versioning using Git. It randomly generates a 5-a-side football team of former and current professional footballers. As I continue my learning journey, I intend to build out new features (e.g., allow users to add their own players to the randomiser, find out more information about their team).

## How to use
This project has been written in JavaScript and can be run using any JavaScript runtime environment. To generate your 5-a-side team, simply run the program.

## Technologies
This project was written in Visual Studio using the Node.js runtime environment.
